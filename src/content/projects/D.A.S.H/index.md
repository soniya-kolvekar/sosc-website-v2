# D.A.S.H

**D.A.S.H (Document And Social Hub)** is a **self-hosted, privacy-first documentation platform** designed to generate structured meeting minutes, social media captions, and formal letters from audio or video content.  
Built with a **local-first philosophy**, D.A.S.H ensures temporary processing, template-driven workflows, and complete control over sensitive data.

Upload recordings from meetings, podcasts, or spoken content and convert them into clean, usable documentation without relying on third-party cloud storage.
