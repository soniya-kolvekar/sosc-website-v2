# Pomelo

**Pomelo** is a lightweight and extensible **online contest platform** designed for hosting programming challenges and coding contests.  
It enables users to write, submit, and evaluate code securely through an integrated execution engine.

The project focuses on **simplicity, scalability, and developer experience**, making it suitable for learning environments and community-driven contests.

---

## Key Features

- **Pluggable Architecture** – Designed to easily integrate or replace components like the code execution engine
- **Customizable Workflows** – Adapt contests, problems, and evaluation logic to fit different use cases
- **Self-Hostable** – Can be deployed and run independently on your own infrastructure
- **Open Source** – Fully open-source and community-driven
- **Scalable by Design** – Built to handle multiple users and concurrent submissions
- **Developer-Friendly** – Clean structure and clear separation of concerns for easy extension

---

## Tech Stack

Pomelo is built using modern web and infrastructure tools:

- **Next.js** – Frontend framework for fast and scalable UI
- **Express.js** – Backend API and contest logic
- **MongoDB** – Database for users, problems, and submissions
- **Judge0** – Secure multi-language code execution
- **Docker** – Containerized development and deployment

---

## Project Goals

- Provide a simple platform for hosting coding contests
- Encourage competitive programming and problem solving
- Offer an open-source base for experimentation and learning
- Maintain a clean and extensible architecture

---
